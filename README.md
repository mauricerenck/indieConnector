IndieConnector is your interface to the IndieWeb. It'll help you to:

-   Receive Webmentions
-   Send Webmentions
-   Post to Mastodon
-   Post to Bluesky
-   Act like a ActivityPub Instance

This plugins handles all the stuff around Webmentions and then normalizes the format and triggers a hook. Other plugins can then subscribe to this hook and use the data.

If you want Webmentions to be shown on your pages, you have to use additional plugins (or write your own) which use IndieConnector to handle Webmentions. For example the [Komments plugin](https://github.com/mauricerenck/komments) which will then show received webmentions as a comment (or in any other way you wish).
